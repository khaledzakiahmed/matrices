# matrices
A demo of a mathematical platform for matrices  to that generated code for you

It not only do all sorts of matrices operations on real and complex matrices but it can automatically generate code for you to create very big libraries that can do complex matrices algorithms on input data so it allows the created library to implement the full algorithm with one press of button
